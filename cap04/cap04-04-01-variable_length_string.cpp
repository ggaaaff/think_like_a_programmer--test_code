Write heap-based implementations for three required string functions:

  - append
  This function takes a string and a character and appends the character
  to the end of the string.

  - concatenate 
  This function takes two strings and appends the characters of the
  second string onto the first.

  - characterAt 
  This function takes a string and a number and returns the character
  at that position in the string (with the first character in the string numbered zero).


  Write the code with the assumption that characterAt will be called frequently,
  while the other two functions will be called relatively seldom. The relative efficiency of
  the operations should reflect the calling frequency.
