/* PROBLEM : CLASS ROSTER

Design a class or set of classes for use in a program that maintains a class roster. 

  For each student, store:  
    the student’s name, ID, and final grade score in the range 0–100.

The program will allow student records to be added or removed; 
display the record of a particular student, identified by ID, with the grade 
  displayed as a number and as a letter; 
and display the average score for the class. 


  The appropriate letter grade for a particular score is shown in Table 5-1.

  Score Range   Letter Grade
     93–100          A
     90–92           A–
     87–89           B+
     83–86           B
     80–82           B–
     77–79           C+
     73–76           C
     70–72           C–
     67–69           D+
     60–66           D
     0–59            F
