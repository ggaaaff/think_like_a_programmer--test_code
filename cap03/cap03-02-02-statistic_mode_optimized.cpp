P R O B L E M : F I N D I N G  T H E  M O D E
In statistics, the mode of a set of values is the value that appears most often. Write
code that processes an array of survey data, where survey takers have responded to
a question with a number in the range 1â€“10, to determine the mode of the data set.
For our purpose, if multiple modes exist, any may be chosen.
