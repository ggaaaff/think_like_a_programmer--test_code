/*
Consider another variant where the
user begins by entering survey responses without telling us the number of
responses, indicating that there are no more responses by entering a â€“1
(a data entry method known as a sentinel).


NOTE: The vector class from the C++ standard template library acts like an
array but grows as necessary. Once declared and initialized, the vector can
be processed exactly the same way as an array.
