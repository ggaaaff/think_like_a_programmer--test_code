/* EXERCISE 3-8:
Write a program that processes an array of student objects and determines
the grade quartiles â€” that is, the grade one would need to score as well as or
 better than 25% of the students, 50% of the students, and 75% of the students.



==== INFORMATION ===
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile

In descriptive statistics, the quartiles of a ranked set of data values are the three points 
that divide the data set into four equal groups, each group comprising a quarter of the data.

  The first quartile (Q1) is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set. 
  The second quartile (Q2) is the median of the data. 
  The third quartile (Q3) is the middle value between the median and the highest value of the data set.

=== PLAN ===

OK - Get information.
- Select a method (one out of three) to do the calculation.
- Calculate the quartiles.
